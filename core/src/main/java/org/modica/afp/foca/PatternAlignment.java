/**
 * The Pattern Data Alignment Code parameter specifies the alignment of the beginning of each
 * characterâ€™s pattern data. The code values assigned to this parameter represent the exponent of
 * the base 2 corresponding to the byte alignment. For example, a code value of 2 means raise the
 * base, 2, to the second power to get the Pattern Data Alignment Value of 4 bytes, a full word.
 * <p>
 * Use of the Pattern Data Alignment parameter allows flexibility in aligning pattern data in
 * storage to permit use of different computing systems with differing abilities in the degree of
 * fineness in addressing storage.
